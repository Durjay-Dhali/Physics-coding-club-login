# Physics Coding Club Login

This is a simple login page for the Physics Coding Club, a school club related to physics. The page is designed to be simple and mobile-friendly, with a blue color scheme and an animated background that responds to the user's mouse movements. 

The login form includes fields for a username and password, and has validation to ensure that both fields are filled out before the user can submit the form. The page also includes a message area that can be used to display error messages or other feedback to the user.

Note that registration for the Physics Coding Club is invite-only, so the login page is intended for members of the club only.

## How to Use
